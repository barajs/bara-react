# bara-react

Build Bara app using React, easily extensible and scalable without any fear of breaking build.

This library belongs to BaraJS Official Library, we build this for the next cross-platforms React app using the architect of reactive functional programming.

By using `bara-react`, you're no longer need to maintain a wired codebase anymore. Build your apps feature by feature. You can quickly implement new features as your app expands or remove a feature when it's deprecated without touching other area of the project.

## Installation

```
yarn add -E bara bara-react
```
 or using NPM

```
npm i --save bara bara-react
```


## Usage

In your main `index.js`:
```javascript

import {register} from 'bara'
import {useReactApp} from 'bara-react'
import App from './App'
import {useDisplayWelcomeMsgTrigger} from './app-trigger'

const myBaraReactApp = () => {
    useReactApp(App)
    useDisplayWelcomeMsgTrigger()
}

register(myBaraReactApp)
```


In your React App `App.jsx':`

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {BaraProvider, Text, Touchable, View} from 'bara-react'

export default const App = () => {
    return (
        <BaraProvider>
            <View>
                <Touchable name="welcome-button">
                    <Text>Hello Bara App!</Text>
                </Touchable>
            </View>
        </BaraProvider>
    )
}
```
Create another file called `app-trigger.js`:

```javascript
import { useTouchablePress, nameOf } from 'bara-react'

export const useDisplayWelcomeMsgTrigger = () => {
    return useTouchablePress({nameOf: nameOf('welcome-button')}, () => {
        alert('Welcome Button has been clicked!')
    })
}
```

## Why I have to build my app this way?

- [x] React is best of rendering.
- [x] Bara is best of reactive functional programming.
- [x] Easily create or remove a component without touching other business components.
- [x] Easily plug and play with BaraJS ecosystem module.
- [ ] It's fun or ... not!
